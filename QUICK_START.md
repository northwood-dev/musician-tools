# Quick Start Guide - Musician Tools Auth System

## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22.x
- PostgreSQL running locally
- Port 5173 (frontend) and 3001 (backend) available

### Step 1: Database Setup (1 min)

Make sure PostgreSQL is running with these credentials in `.env`:
```
DATABASE_URL_DEV=postgresql://musician_user:musician_pass@localhost:5433/musician_tools
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (2 min)

```bash
# Frontend
npm install

# Backend
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Run Migrations (1 min)

```bash
cd backend
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all   # verified test account (development only)
cd ..
```

With Docker: `make migrate` then `make seed`.

### Step 4: Start Servers (1 min)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
# Listening on http://localhost:3001
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Listening on http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 5: Test It! (✨ Done)

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Sign in with the seeded account: `test@example.com` / `password123` (already verified, empty songlist)
3. You're in! Create, edit, delete songs
4. Each user only sees their own songs 🔒

Rerun the seed any time to get that account back fresh: it is deleted and recreated, empty. It
refuses to run outside `NODE_ENV=development` or against a non-local database.

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Registration
```
✓ Valid registration creates user
✓ Duplicate email rejected
✓ Duplicate username rejected
✓ Password hashed with bcryptjs
```

### Login
```
✓ Login with email works
✓ Login with username works
✓ Case-insensitive username lookup
✓ Wrong password rejected
✓ Session created (30-day cookie)
✓ JWT token generated (24h expiry)
```

### Songs
```
✓ User only sees their own songs
✓ Creating song assigns to current user
✓ Edit own song works
✓ Cannot edit other user's song (403)
✓ Cannot delete other user's song (403)
✓ Last played date updates on "Play now"
✓ Songs sorted by last played
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port 3001 already in use
```bash
# Kill existing process
lsof -i :3001 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
```

### Database connection error
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5433
```
→ Make sure PostgreSQL is running on port 5433, or update DATABASE_URL_DEV in .env

### Migration fails
```bash
# Reset migrations (CAREFUL - drops tables)
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

### Frontend shows blank page
```bash
# Clear vite cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 What's Next

After setup, consider:

- [ ] User profile page (edit name, email)
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] Song search/filtering
- [ ] Export songs to PDF
- [ ] Collaborative playlists
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)
- [ ] Cloud backup

---

## 📝 Notes

- Passwords are hashed with bcryptjs (salt=10)
- Sessions persist across page reloads (localStorage + cookie)
- All song operations are scoped to authenticated user
- Ownership enforced at controller level (server-side)
- Database CASCADE deletes songs when user is deleted

**Happy coding! 🎵**
